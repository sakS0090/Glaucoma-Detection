Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness. Its detection is a time-consuming and costly process. Development of a Deep Learning model leveraging advanced neural networks
that facilitates the process of Glaucoma detection and that can effectively work in the absence of excessive equipment, skilled medical practitioners, and is time efficient.

Proposed Solution
1.Read the data from the datasets.
2.Perform Pre-processing of the input dataset by adjusting the contrast, edges, image quality.
3.To perform image augmentation to increase the image set, to detect the correct affected area from the image, apply binarization to the images to secure them from being affected by various other colors. 
4.Perform feature extraction and classification using CNN.
5.Generation of evaluation metrics
6.Assessment of results.
